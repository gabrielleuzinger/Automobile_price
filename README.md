This repository contains a **Model to predict car prices** based on the dataset available at the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile). objective is to create a model to predict car prices base on its attributes. This project was set up following the premises of [Reproducible Research](https://pt.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research), so that anyone can achieve the same results as me using the steps I followed in Jupyter Notebook.

# Project libraries


All dependencies can be found in the file  `requirements.txt`, but are also listed below:
* Numpy
* Scikit-Learn
* Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook
* Matplotlib
* statsmodels

To install the dependencies run in the project's main folder : `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

To access the Jupyter Notebook that I created, run in the root folder of the `jupyter notebook` project. Soon after, your browser will open and just select the file `Automobile Data Set.ipynb`.  

# Project structure

```{sh}
  .
  |-report

  |-data
  |- Automobile Data Set.ipynb
  |- requirements.txt
```

The folder `report` contains a md file with a version of the report generated from the study done on that project. This file contains **all the insights and studies that were done, as well as a detailed description of how the project was developed**.

**All references used to create this project are described in the report**.
